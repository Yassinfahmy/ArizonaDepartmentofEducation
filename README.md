# Introduction 
This project was started to transform the state school accountability code to an open source language (Python). Efferts were made to increase collaboration with experts on educational data in the field and allow cross- state collaboration with other accountability teams.
The code was developed into three disticnt libraries.
* StaticFile is an object oriented data pipline designed to tranform data into a standard shared by all schools and districts accross 
Arizona. Within the folderr "Construct staticfile" is an example of how to use the staticfile library.
* StateCode is an object oriented library desgined to manipulate data from the staticfile in order to statistically distinguish schools based on the State Board of Education aprroved accountability plan. The "ADEConnect" file is the orchestrator script that ties all parts together.
